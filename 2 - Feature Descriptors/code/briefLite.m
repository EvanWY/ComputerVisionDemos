function [locs, desc] = briefLite(im)
% INPUTS
% im - gray image with values between 0 and 1
%
% OUTPUTS
% locs - an m x 3 vector, where the first two columns are the image coordinates 
% 		 of keypoints and the third column is the pyramid level of the keypoints
% desc - an m x n bits matrix of stacked BRIEF descriptors. 
%		 m is the number of valid descriptors in the image and will vary
% 		 n is the number of bits for the BRIEF descriptor
